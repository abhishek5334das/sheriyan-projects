        <h2>My First Blog</h2>
        <p> This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all. In
            this post, I will be talking about my day.</p>
            <p>Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in the
                park. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and
                children playing. It was very refreshing </p>
